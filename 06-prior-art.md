# Prior art
[prior-art]: #prior-art

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal.
A few examples of what this can include are:

- For language, library, cargo, tools, and compiler proposals: Does this feature exist in other
  programming languages and what experience have their community had?
- For community proposals: Is this done by some other community and what were their experiences with
  it?
- For other teams: What lessons can we learn from what other communities have done here?
- Papers: Are there any published papers or great posts that discuss this? If you have some
  relevant papers to refer to, this can serve as a more detailed theoretical background.

This section is intended to encourage you as an author to think about the lessons from other
languages, provide readers of your RFC with a fuller picture. If there is no prior art, that is
fine - your ideas are interesting to us whether they are brand new or if it is an adaptation from
other languages.

Note that while precedent set by other languages is some motivation, it does not on its own
motivate an RFC. Please also take into consideration that Rust sometimes intentionally diverges
from common language features.
