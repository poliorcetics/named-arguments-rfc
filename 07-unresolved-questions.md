# Unresolved questions

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this feature
  before stabilization?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be addressed in the
  future independently of the solution that comes out of this RFC?

## Defaults parameters

Default parameters and named arguments are often cited together but in reality they are quite
orthogonal features. They compose well together in several languages but that does not means they
are inseparable from a design point of view.

Whether they should be added to Rust or not should be considered in another RFC.
